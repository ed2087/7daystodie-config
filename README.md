7 Days to Die – Balanced Horde Overhaul (Custom Config Mod)

This mod is a full XML gameplay rebalance that makes 7 Days to Die feel like an actual survival game again. Zombies hit smarter, spawn in real hordes, weapons matter, tools feel like tools, and vehicles behave like they should. The whole thing is built for max difficulty and for players who want challenge without the grindy, boring parts.

Zombies & Animals
	•	Adjusted zombie reach for proper balance

	•	Improved horde behavior through spawn file edits
	•	Zombie animals also rebalanced
	•	Combat feels tighter, fairer, and way more intense

	•	Makes progression feel smoother without breaking balance

Item Stacking (New Feature)

For players who don’t have hours per night to babysit loot:
	•	All stackables increased to 1000
	•	All core materials increased to 10,000
	•	Rock
	•	Sand
	•	All resource materials
	•	Anything that originally stacked to 6k or 10k is now cleanly at 10k

This fixes the annoying cycle of dropping your mining loot during Blood Moons or POI runs and having to walk back 30 times.

Storage capacity of vehicles was NOT modified — only stack sizes.

Gameplay Experience

This mod is built for:
	•	Max difficulty
	•	Feral sense ON
	•	Night zombies running/sprinting
	•	Co-op or server play, but still works fine solo

It forces you to:
	•	Be quiet
	•	Be smart
	•	Manage ammo
	•	Respect the green zones
	•	Treat every encounter like survival, not a looter-shooter

⸻

How It Works

Everything is done through XML edits:
	•	entityclasses.xml
	•	items.xml
	•	blocks.xml
	•	entitygroups.xml
	•	spawning.xml
	•	Other related config files

No DLLs. No extra dependencies.
